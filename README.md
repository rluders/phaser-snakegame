Snake Game Created with Phaser and TypeScript
=====

This is my first contact with Phaser and TypeScript.

To create this game I just followed the Danny Markov's Tutorial and change it to TypeScript.

I know there's some bugs and somethings to make it better, but for now it's fine.

Thanks to my friend Jorge Pellegrino for all the game art. (I can't make it without your help, bro!)
